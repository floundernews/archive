Davis</div><p>A new Toronto bridge has been diverting traffic off of the busy Gardiner Expressway year. Reports confirmed Friday that the bridge, affectionately named Bridgey McBridgeface, was made entirely out of popsicle sticks and wood glue. Mackenzie graduate and lead engineer, Warren Trust, was nominated for the Suzuki Distinction Award, as well as two engineering awards for environmental innovation.</p><p>\"I just thought that this was how bridges were made,\" said Trust at the press conference.</p><p>The science department at Mackenzie is very proud of Trust's achievement. \"This is exactly why the grade 11 bridge project exists. It's a fountain of knowledge that is applicable, practical, and real-world,\" added a Mackenzie teacher.</p><p>McBridgeface's consideration for the environmental awards is due to its materials being fully biodegradable and made of recycled materials.</p><p>\"The bridge gives off a pleasant smell, sort of like orange creamsicles. I experience this aroma every day as I drive over it, reminding me of summer,\" said one commuter.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bridgey McBridgeface will not last long. One of its legs has already started to biodegrade and the bridge will turn into a rich bed of compost by June.</p>", "img": "img/popsicle-bridge.jpg"}
