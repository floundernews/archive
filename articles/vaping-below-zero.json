They took notice, and responded by implementing a highly effective strategy: new signs posted on all bathroom doors that say \u201cNO SMOKING, NO VAPING (e-cigarettes)\u201d. These small, thin plastic boards have had a wide and impactful effect on the Mackenzie community.</p><p>A survey conducted by The Flounder showed that the previous 34% of the school that vaped, has dramatically decreased by 48% over the last six weeks. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think it possible for the number to drop below zero, but that was before we took into account the amount of students that have been deterred from vaping in the future,\u201d said the Mackenzie Vaping Officer.</p><div class=image><img src=\"img/vaping-below-zero.png\"><p>The figures were calculated by a convoluted process that involved multiplying the total number of vapers by the latitude of the school, then dividing the product by the total number of students, multiplied by the number of letters in the school\u2019s name. \u201cFuture trends, we decided, should be considered negative,\u201d said the Official Mackenzie Statistic Fabricator.</p></div><p>The capitalized text and strong wording on the sign, combined with its clean and minimalistic layout, has seemingly done the trick. An anonymous student commented: \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t think the signs would achieve anything. But after a couple of days, I really felt impacted by them. They changed the way I see the whole issue.\u201d</p><p>Last year, a North Vancouver high school had to shut down almost all of its student bathrooms in an attempt to prevent kids from vaping at school. Mackenzie thankfully realizes the importance of bathroom privileges, and has created a very unique solution to this emerging problem, one that doesn\u2019t involve students holding in their bladder for the day, and gives the hall monitors a break from barging into bathrooms.</p><p>Data collected from Mackenzie\u2019s Department of Statistic Fabrication.</p>", "img": "img/vaping-below-zero.png"}
